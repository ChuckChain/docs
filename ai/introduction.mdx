<Warning>**Notice:** The Livepeer AI Video Subnet is currently in its Alpha phase. During this early stage, you may encounter various bugs or issues. Should you discover any problems, please report them via our [issue tracker](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/issues/new/choose) on GitHub. We appreciate your patience and feedback as we work to improve the AI Subnet. Your contributions are vital to our progress, and we look forward to seeing what you'll create!</Warning>

### Introduction

The **AI Subnet** is the newest addition to the Livepeer ecosystem, first outlined in [this SPE treasury proposal](https://explorer.livepeer.org/treasury/82843445347363563575858115586375001878287509193479217286690041153234635982713). This cutting-edge platform provides a **decentralized**, **open-source** framework for a broad array of Generative AI inference tasks, including image and video generation and upscaling, all within the Livepeer network. Leveraging Livepeer's decentralized protocol, the AI Subnet offers accessible, cost-effective generative AI capabilities, empowering developers and creators worldwide to incorporate advanced AI tools into their projects.

### Key Components

- **AI Orchestrator**: This is a specialized node tasked with carrying out AI inference operations within the subnet.
- **AI Gateway**: A designated node that routes AI tasks to the correct AI Orchestrators for processing.
- **Mainnet Transcoding Network**: This network comprises Orchestrators and Gateways that coordinate transcoding tasks over the mainnet.
- **AI Subnet**: Represents the interconnected framework of AI Orchestrators and AI Gateways, designed to streamline the processing of AI inference tasks on the Livepeer network.
