You've chosen to join the AI Video Subnet and perform **AI inference** on the
Livepeer network, earning fees in the process. This guide will help you get
started with the AI Orchestrator. It mirrors the
[Orchestrator Setup Guide](/orchestrators/guides/get-started) for the Mainnet
Transcoding Network, with minor adjustments for AI operations. Navigate through
the subpages in this guide for a step-by-step walkthrough. For a deeper dive
into running an orchestrator, see the
[Orchestrator Setup Guide](/orchestrators/guides/get-started).
