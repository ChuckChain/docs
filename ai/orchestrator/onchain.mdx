title: On-chain Configuration
---

In the previous section we covered the **off-chain** configuration of the AI Orchestrator node. In this section, we will cover how to connect your AI Orchestrator node to the AI subnet and earn fees for processing AI inference jobs.

## Prerequisites

- An established [Mainnet Orchestrator](/orchestrators/guides/get-started) within the Top 100 on the Livepeer network.
- A dedicated static IP address or domain for your AI Orchestrator.
- An additional Ethereum wallet, funded with enough gas to cover transaction fees for ticket redemption.

## Advertising Your AI Service URI

To make your *AI Orchestrator* discoverable by *AI Gateway* nodes on the AI subnet, you need to advertise your **AI service URI** on-chain. This can be done by registering your service URI with the [AIServiceRegistry](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5) contract on the [Arbitrum Mainnet](https://arbitrum.io). The simplest way to do this is by using the [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) smart contract deployment toolchain.

1. **Install Foundry** using the following commands:

    ```bash
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    source /home/<USERNAME>/.bashrc
    foundryup
    ```

2. **Set your Service URI** using the `SetServiceURI` function on the [AIServiceRegistry](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5) contract. Utilize the KeyStore file and password from your *Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator* wallet:

    ```bash
    cast send --keystore '<PATH_TO_KEYSTORE_FILE>' --password '<PASSWORD>' --rpc-url <ARBITRUM_RPC_URI> 0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5 "setServiceURI(string)" https://<PUBLIC_ORCH_IP_OR_URL>:<PUBLIC_ORCH_PORT>
    ```

    Upon successful execution, the output should resemble the following:

    ```bash
    blockHash:               0x214a65d2dffd1732e971bd3662dcb681663c2eb0c95a33c8918bab0a44e2d3ed
    blockNumber:             200370198
    ```

3. **Verify your Service URI** by calling the `getServiceURI` function on the [AIServiceRegistry](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5d31637eb0f442376053d5dea2347f663c4019dc) contract:

    ```bash
    cast call --rpc-url <ARBITRUM_RPC_URI> 0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5 "getServiceURI(address)" <PUBLIC_WALLET_KEY> | xxd -r -p
    ```

    If successful, you should see the following output:

    ```bash
    https://<PUBLIC_ORCH_IP_OR_URL>:<PUBLIC_ORCH_PORT>
    ```

Well done! Your _AI Orchestrator_ is now discoverable by _AI Gateway_ nodes and primed to execute AI inference tasks on the AI Subnet. Onwards! ðŸš€
