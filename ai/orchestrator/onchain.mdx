title: On-chain Configuration
---

In the previous section we covered the **off-chain** configuration of the AI
Orchestrator node. In this section, we will cover how to connect your AI
Orchestrator node to the AI subnet and earn fees for processing AI inference
jobs.

## Prerequisites

- An established [Mainnet Orchestrator](/orchestrators/guides/get-started)
  within the Top 100 on the Livepeer network.
- A dedicated static IP address or domain for your AI Orchestrator.
- An additional Ethereum wallet, funded with enough gas to cover transaction
  fees for ticket redemption.

## Advertising Your AI Service URI

To make your _AI Orchestrator_ discoverable by _AI Gateway_ nodes on the AI
subnet, you need to advertise your **AI service URI** on-chain. This can be
achieved by registering your service URI with the
[AIServiceRegistry](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5)
contract on the [Arbitrum Mainnet](https://arbitrum.io).

  <Tab title="Use Foundry Cast">
    The easiest and recommended method is to use the [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) smart contract deployment toolchain.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install Foundry Cast">
        Install [Foundry Cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/) by executing the following commands in your terminal:

          ```bash
          curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
          source /home/<USERNAME>/.bashrc
          foundryup
          ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set your Service URI">
        Set your Service URI with the `SetServiceURI` function on the [AIServiceRegistry](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5) contract. Use the KeyStore file and password from your *Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator* wallet:

        ```bash
        cast send --keystore '<PATH_TO_KEYSTORE_FILE>' --password '<PASSWORD>' --rpc-url <ARBITRUM_RPC_URI> 0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5 "setServiceURI(string)" https://<PUBLIC_ORCH_IP_OR_URL>:<PUBLIC_ORCH_PORT>
        ```

        After successful execution, the output should look like this:

        ```bash
        blockHash:               0x214a65d2dffd1732e971bd3662dcb681663c2eb0c95a33c8918bab0a44e2d3ed
        blockNumber:             200370198
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify your Service URI">
        Verify your Service URI by invoking the `getServiceURI` function on the [AIServiceRegistry](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5d31637eb0f442376053d5dea2347f663c4019dc) contract:

        ```bash
        cast call --rpc-url <ARBITRUM_RPC_URI> 0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5 "getServiceURI(address)" <PUBLIC_WALLET_KEY> | xxd -r -p
        ```

        If successful, the output should be:

        ```bash
        https://<PUBLIC_ORCH_IP_OR_URL>:<PUBLIC_ORCH_PORT>
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    Congratulation! Your *AI Orchestrator* is now discoverable by *AI Gateway* nodes and primed to execute AI inference tasks on the AI Subnet. Onwards! ðŸš€

  <Tab title="Use Arbitrum Explorer">
    If you prefer to interact with the contract through your browser, use the [Arbitrum Explorer](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5) to call the `setServiceURI` function on the [AIServiceRegistry](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5) contract.

    <Steps>
        <Step title="Import Your Wallet">
            Import the Ethereum wallet associated with your *Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator* into your wallet browser extension. The steps to import your wallet may vary depending on the extension you are using. The steps for MetaMask can be found [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-How-to-import-an-account).
        </Step>
        <Step title="Open the Contract page in the Arbitrum Explorer">
            Visit the [AIServiceRegistry](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5) contract page on the Arbitrum Explorer and click on the `Contract` tab.

        </Step>
        <Step title="Connect your Wallet">
            Click the `Write Contract` button on the contract page and connect your wallet to the Arbitrum Explorer by clicking the `Connect to Web3` button. Select the wallet you imported in the first step.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Call the setServiceURI function">
            Access the [setServiceURI](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5#writeContract#F2) function on the contract page and input the `Service URI` for your AI Orchestrator in the `_serviceURI` field. After clicking the `Write` button to execute the function, you mustto confirm the transaction in your wallet extension. Once the transaction is confirmed, which your wallet will notify you of, your AI Orchestrator's `Service URI` will be successfully set.

        </Step>
        <Step title="Verify the Service URI">
            To verify that the `Service URI` has been set correctly, click the `Read Contract` button on the contract page. Access the [getServiceURI](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x04C0b249740175999E5BF5c9ac1dA92431EF34C5#readContract#F2) function and input the address of your *Mainnet Transcoding Network Orchestrator* in the `_addr` field. Click the `Query` button to retrieve the `Service URI` set for your AI Orchestrator.
        </Step>
    </Steps>

    Congratulation! Your *AI Orchestrator* is now discoverable by *AI Gateway* nodes and primed to execute AI inference tasks on the AI Subnet. Onwards! ðŸš€
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Use Livepeer CLI">
    <Note>Currently, setting your AI service URI using the Livepeer CLI is not supported during the **Alpha** phase of the AI Subnet. This feature will be added in future releases.</Note>
